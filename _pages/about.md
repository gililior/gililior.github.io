I am a Ph.D. candidate in Natural Language Processing (NLP)
at [The Hebrew University of Jerusalem](https://new.huji.ac.il/), 
advised by [Dr. Gabriel Stanovsky](https://gabrielstanovsky.github.io/).
I am currently a research intern at Google Research and previously interned at IBM Research and Allen Institute for AI (AI2).

My research focuses on evaluating large language models (LLMs) through a cognitive perspective. I study fundamental skills that humans carry out effortlessly—such as integrating information across documents, adapting to multiple instructions, or reasoning reliably—and ask how well LLMs perform on these dimensions. Beyond evaluation, I also explore ways to mitigate the gaps revealed in this process, aiming to design cognitively grounded benchmarks and methods that foster more reliable, interpretable, and trustworthy AI systems.

I'm also a dogs lover, pop music fan, and a former [professional basketball player](https://www.fiba.basketball/europe/u20women/2016/player/Gili-Lior).
