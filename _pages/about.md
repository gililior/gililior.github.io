I am a Ph.D. student specializing in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computational Linguistics,
at [The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel](https://new.huji.ac.il/).
Under the guidance of my advisor, [Dr. Gabriel Stanovsky](https://gabrielstanovsky.github.io/),
my research focuses on exploring the intersection between human cognition and NLP, 
and how these two fields can mutually benefit and contribute to each other's advancements. 
Moreover, I have a strong interest in unsupervised learning, to enable developing cross-domain solutions for various tasks.

I'm also a dogs lover, pop-music fan, and a former [professional basket player](https://www.fiba.basketball/europe/u20women/2016/player/Gili-Lior)
