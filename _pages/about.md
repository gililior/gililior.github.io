<p class="page__lead">
Ph.D. candidate in NLP at <a href="https://new.huji.ac.il/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Hebrew University of Jerusalem</a>.
I study how to <strong>evaluate</strong>—and ultimately <strong>improve</strong>—large language models (LLMs) through a cognitive lens.
</p>

My research asks how well LLMs perform core cognitive-like skills (e.g., reliably following multiple simple instructions, integrating information across documents, or staying consistent across prompts)
and how we can **mitigate** the gaps we uncover. I aim to build cognitively grounded evaluation frameworks and methods that make AI more reliable, interpretable, and trustworthy.

### Currently
- Ph.D. candidate advised by <a href="https://gabrielstanovsky.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dr. Gabriel Stanovsky</a>.
- Research intern at Google Research; previously at IBM Research and <a href="https://allenai.org/ai2-israel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AI2 Israel</a>.

### Research themes
- **Reliable evaluation & robustness** – methods that account for inconsistency and prompt sensitivity.  
- **Information integration at scale** – skimming-like behavior and multi-document use.  
- **Multi-constraint instruction following** – handling several simple constraints simultaneously.
