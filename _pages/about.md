I am a Ph.D. candidate, exploring the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computational Linguistics,
at [The Hebrew University of Jerusalem](https://new.huji.ac.il/), 
advised by [Dr. Gabriel Stanovsky](https://gabrielstanovsky.github.io/).
I am currently a research intern at Google Research and previously interned at IBM Research and [AI2 Israel](https://allenai.org/ai2-israel).

My research resides at the intersection of large language models (LLMs) and human cognition, within the domain of Natural Language Processing (NLP). I explore the mutual benefits of these two fields, categorizing it into my three primary research areas. First, I leverage LLMs to extract novel insights into human behavior and cognitive processes. Second, I conduct experiments involving both humans and models to enhance the understanding of model outputs through the lens of cognitive science. Finally, I develop improved LLMs by incorporating principles inspired by human cognitive mechanisms. 
My PhD research delves into these three directions, aimed to advance the development of interpretable and trustworthy AI systems.

I'm also a dogs lover, pop music fan, and a former [professional basketball player](https://www.fiba.basketball/europe/u20women/2016/player/Gili-Lior).
