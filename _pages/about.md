I am a Ph.D. student, exploring the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computational Linguistics,
at [The Hebrew University of Jerusalem](https://new.huji.ac.il/), 
advised by [Dr. Gabriel Stanovsky](https://gabrielstanovsky.github.io/).

I am interested in exploring the intersection between human cognition and NLP, 
and how these two fields can mutually benefit and contribute to each other's advancements. 

In addition, I am a research intern in [AI2 Israel](https://allenai.org/ai2-israel), 
working on developing unsupervised learning methods to enable cross-domain solutions for various tasks.

I'm also a dogs lover, pop-music fan, and a former [professional basketball player](https://www.fiba.basketball/europe/u20women/2016/player/Gili-Lior).
